# Sub4Sub Web Application
This is a fully open-source advanced Sub4Sub Web Application made with PHP and MySQL database by Hiranmay Roy and Sameer Pathak.

A "sub4sub" website is a platform where users exchange subscriptions (subs) for their YouTube channels with each other. The idea is that if you subscribe to someone else's channel, they will subscribe to yours in return. It's often used to artificially boost subscriber counts.
